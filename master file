 Code Grand Slam 

``` 
# Function to load assets
def load_assets():
    scene.setBackgroundImage(codegrandslam_asset_court.tenniscourt_background)
    leftracquet = sprites.create(codegrandslam_asset_court.image`left_racquet`)
    rightracquet = sprites.create(codegrandslam_asset_court.image`right_racquet`)
    ball = sprites.create(codegrandslam_asset_court.image`ball`)
    return leftracquet, rightracquet, ball

# Call the function to load assets
leftracquet, rightracquet, ball = load_assets()

leftracquet = sprites.create(codegrandslam_asset_court.image("left_racquet"))
rightracquet = sprites.create(codegrandslam_asset_court.image("right_racquet"))
ball = sprites.create(codegrandslam_asset_court.image("ball"))
scene.setBackgroundImage(codegrandslam_asset_court.tenniscourt_background)

```

## Step 1 
The ``||loops:on start||`` block is the first thing that runs when our game begins.

The ``||loops:on start||`` block has already been placed into the workspace for you.

Let's set the background for our game.  From the ``||scene: scene||`` menu, select the ``||scene:setBackgroundImage||``. 

Drag the block into the ``||loops:on start||``. 

Click on the grey box to select the background image. There is a precreated asset that looks like a court, click that asset to make it the background of the game. 
## Step 2 

To create our players for the game we are going to use ``||functions: functions||``.

1. Expand the ``||advanced:Advanced||`` dropdown.
2. Click the ``||functions:Functions||`` category.
3. Click ``||arrays:Make a Function...||``
4. Type "LeftRacquet" where it says "doSomething". 
5. Click ``||loops:Done ✓||``

## Step 3 
To create our players, we will also use variables. 

1. Click the ``|| variables: variables||`` category. 
2. Click  "Make a variable". 
3. Type Left Racquet and to name your variable. 
4. From the ``||variables: variables||`` menu, select the ``||variables: set variable to||`` and drag it into the ``|||function:LeftRacquet||``. 

## Step 4 
To create our player, select the ``|| sprites: sprite of kind player||`` and replace the 0 with the block. 

Click the player dropdown menu and select "create new Kind". From there, type "LeftRacquet". 

Select the Red Racquet from the Asset menu by clicking on the grey box. 


## Step 5 
To control our player movement, we will need to set up controls. 
1. From the ``|| controller: controller||`` section, select ``||controller: move mysprite with buttons||`` and drag it into the Left Racquet Function. 
2. Click the plus button at the end of the block. 
3. Now we can adjust the velocity that the racquet will move with. 
4. Make vx equal to 0 and vy equal to 150. 

## Step 6 
We have 2 steps left to set up our players. 
1. Select ``||sprites: set mysprite x to 0||`` and drag it into the bottom of the left racquet function. 
2. Click the drop down arrow on the x and select "Left". 
3. Finally select the ``||sprites: set mySprite to stay in screen||`` and drag it into the function. 

## Step 7

Now that we have set up this function to act as a player, we need to function to run. 

We can do this by selecting ``||functions: callleftracquet||`` and dragging it into the ``||loops: on sart||`` block. 

Now verytime the game starts, this player will automatically run. 

## Step 8
Now we will repeat those steps, with a few changes, to create the other player. 

1. Expand the ``||advanced:Advanced||`` dropdown.
2. Click the ``||functions:Functions||`` category.
3. Click ``||arrays:Make a Function...||``
4. Type "RightRacquet" where it says "doSomething". 
5. Click ``||loops:Done ✓||`` 

## Step 9
Let's create a new variable to make our second racquet. 

1. Click the ``|| variables: variables||`` category. 
2. Click  "Make a variable". 
3. Type Right Racquet and to name your variable. 
4. From the ``||variables: variables||`` menu, select the ``||variables: set variable to||`` and drag it into the ``||function:RightRacquet||``. 
5. Expand the dropdown menu and select "RightRacquet". 

## Step 10
To create our player, select the ``|| sprites: sprite of kind player||`` and replace the 0 with the block. 

Click the player dropdown menu and select "create new Kind". From there, type "RightRacquet". 

Select the Blue Racquet from the Asset menu by clicking on the grey box. 

## Step 11
To control our player movement, we will need to set up controls. 
1. From the ``|| controller: controller||`` section, select ``||controller: player 2 move mySprite with buttons ||`` and drag it into the Right Racquet Function. 
2. Click the plus button at the end of the block. 
3. Now we can adjust the velocity that the racquet will move with. 
4. Replace the vx 0 with a ``||controller: player 2 dy (up-down buttons)||`` and make vy equal to "150". 


## Step 12
We have 2 steps left to set up our second player. 

1. Select ``||sprites: set mysprite x to 0||`` and drag it into the bottom of the right racquet function. 
2. Click the drop down arrow on the x and select "Right". Replace the 0 at the end of the block with "164".
3. Finally select the ``||sprites: set mySprite to stay in screen||`` and drag it into the function. 

Now that we have set up this function to act as a player, we need to function to run. 
We can do this by selecting ``||functions: callrighttracquet||`` and dragging it into the ``||loops: on sart||`` block. 

## Step 13
Now that we have our players, we need to create the ball they will play with! We will do this by creating a 3rd ``||function:function||``. 

1. Expand the ``||advanced:Advanced||`` dropdown.
2. Click the ``||functions:Functions||`` category.
3. Click ``||arrays:Make a Function...||``
4. Type "createBall" where it says "doSomething". 
5. Click ``||loops:Done ✓||`` 

## Step 14
We will also need to create a new variable for the ball. To create it: 

1. Click the ``|| variables: variables||`` category. 
2. Click  "Make a variable". 
3. Type ball and to name the variable. 
4. From the ``||variables: variables||`` menu, select the ``||variables: set variable to||`` and drag it into the ``||function: createBall||`` block.  
5. Expand the Mysprite dropdown menu and select ball. 


## Step 15
To create our player, select the ``|| sprites: sprite of kind player||`` and replace the 0 with the block. 

Expand the player dropdown menu and select "Projectile". 

Select the ball from the Asset menu by clicking on the grey box inside the block. 

## Step 16
To control how the ball will act in the game, we need to adjust the velocity. 
1. From the ``|sprites: sprites||``menu,   select ``||sprites: set mySprite velocity ||``
2. Replace both of the current pre set to 100. 
3. vx should now be 100 and vy should also be 100. 
This will allow for more dynamic game play, so if the ball is moving too fast for you, you can adjust these numbers. 

## Step 17
In the last two steps to create the ball, we will need 2 blocks from the ``||sprites: sprites||`` menu. 
1. Select the ``|| sprites: set my sprite to bounce on wall||`` and drag it into the create ball function. 
2. Click the mySprite dropdown and select ball. 
3. Now, select the ``||sprites: set mySprite x to||`` and drag it into the createBall function. 
4. Click the mySprite dropdown and select ball. 
5. Click the x dropdown and click y. 
6. We don't want our players to be able to predict how the ball will move in the y direction, so we will need a ``||math:math ||`` block to make the game harder. 
7. From the ``|| math:math||`` menu, select the ``||math: pick random||`` and drag it into the last block to replace the 0. 
8. Set the random to be from 0- 120 (the size of the screen). 

## Step 18 
Finally, we will need to call the ball function so that it runs just like our players. 
We can do this by selecting ``||functions: ball||`` and dragging it into the ``||loops: on sart||`` block. 

Now all 3 of our functions will run when the game starts!

## Step 19 

Now that all of our players are set up, we need to set up game parameters. 
1. Select a ``||sprite: on sprite of kind player overlaps with otherSprite of kind player||`` and drag it into the workspace. 
2. Click the first dropdown and select "leftracquet". 
3. Click the second dropdown and select "Projectile". 
4. To adjust the score, from ``||Info:Info||`` select a ``||info: change player 2 score by||`` and drag it into the overlap block. 
5. Click the dropdown menu and select Player 1. 
6. Finally, let's add some noise to our game! Grab a ``||music: play sound until done||`` and drag it into the overlap block. 
7. Select your sound, we used the buzzer noise. 

## Step 20 

Let's repeat those steps to create the second player's score. 
1. Select a ``||sprite: on sprite of kind player overlaps with otherSprite of kind player||`` and drag it into the workspace. 
2. Click the first dropdown and select "rightracquet". 
3. Click the second dropdown and select "Projectile". 
4. To adjust the score, from ``||Info:Info||`` select a ``||info: change player 2 score by||`` and drag it into the overlap block. 
6. Let's add some noise to our game! Grab a ``||music: play sound until done||`` and drag it into the overlap block. 
7. Select your sound, we used the buzzer noise. 

## Step 21 
We want to make sure that our score is is even to start out. 
From the ``||info:info||`` menu: 
1. Select the ``||info: set score to 0||`` 
2. Drag this block to the bottom of the ``||loops: on start||`` block. 

## Step 22 
Tennis sets rquire players to reach 40 points to win, so let's recreate that for our game! 
1. From the ``||info: info||`` menu, select ``||info: on player 2 score||`` and drag it into the workspace. 
2. Click the drop down arrow and select player 1 
3. Change the score from 100 and type 40. 
4. Select a ``||multiplayer: game over plaer 1 wins||11 block and put it into the info block. 
5. Make sure it says Player 1 wins 
6. Finally, from the ``||game:game||`` menu, select a ``||game:use message GAME OVER for win||`` block and drag it into info block. 
7. Change the message to "Player 1 wins!" 

## Step 23 
We will need to recreate the parameters, but this time with Player 2 winning. 
1. From the ``||info: info||`` menu, 
    select ``||info: on player 2 score||`` and drag it into the workspace. 
2. Click the drop down arrow and select Player 2
3. Change the score from 100 and type 40. 
4. Select a ``||multiplayer: game over plaer 1 wins||`` block and put it into the info block.

6. Finally, from the ``||game:game||`` menu, select a ``||game:use message GAME OVER for win||`` block and drag it into info block. 
7. Change the message to "Player 2 wins!" 

## Step 24 
Your game is now ready to play! You can click donw once you read this message.
